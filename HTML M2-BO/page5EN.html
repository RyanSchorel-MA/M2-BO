    <h3>The History of the National Video Game Museum</h3>
 

<p>In 2016, Hasan came into contact with Jan Kragt, city marketer of the municipality of Zoetermeer, 
    who, deeply impressed by the collection, suggested the idea of turning it into a museum and establishing a foundation for that purpose.</p>
<p> On the spot, Hasan and Jan came up with the name and the National Video Game Museum was born.</p> 
<p>Together with several key players in the Dutch game community, the National Videogame Museum Foundation was then created.</p>

 

<p>The city council was enthusiastic about the idea and decided to support the museum financially. 
    This made it possible to rent a heated storage facility where the entire collection could be housed and partially exhibited.</p>

 

<p>In early 2017, in close cooperation with the municipality, a real museum location was found: the former V&D building in Zoetermeer's city center.</p>
<h3>What can you do at the museum?</h3>
<p>The museum also lets its visitors experience the games of tomorrow. </p>
 <p> Gamers young and old are welcome to play, 
    discover, 
    learn and share experiences online.  </p>
    During school vacations, we are also open on Mondays and Tuesdays. 
    Children under 10 years of age may enter the museum only when accompanied.</p>
