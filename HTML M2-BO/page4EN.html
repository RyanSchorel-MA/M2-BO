      <h1> Review [2 Stars]</h1>
      <p>The gamehall is very nicely set up. 
        Definitely the history of gaming to today's arcade experience.
         The only downside is, which by the way annoyed me a bit,
          that most of the arcade didn't do</p>

      <h1> Review [5 Stars]</h1>
      <p>Ya cool, 
        so many machines, 
        consoles and automatics. 
        Very varied too, 
        there is everything. 
        Nostalgia. 
        Definitely recommended if you have fond memories of old arcades, 
        the NES and pinball machines!</p>

      <h1> Review [3 Stars]</h1>
      <p>Eand video games paradise in a mall. 
        Nice to visit once. 
        Although I am not a video game connoisseur, 
        nice to visit. The machines were a little sticky. 
        Fortunately some places with disinfectant to clean. 
        And toilet was less clean.</p>
